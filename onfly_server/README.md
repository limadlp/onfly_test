# Onfly API - Simple JSON-based Backend

**Author:** Dan Lima

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This is a **very simple backend** built with **Dart Shelf**, created solely to allow the app to function since an official API was not provided.

ðŸš€ **Key Features:**

- **NoSQL JSON-based storage** (no database installation required).
- **User authentication** (email/password-based login).
- **Expense management** (CRUD operations for travel expenses).
- **Portable & lightweight** (works in any environment with Dart installed).
- **Uses Shelf & Shelf Router** for API routing.
