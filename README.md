# Onfly Expense Management System

This project is a **corporate travel expense management system**, developed using **Flutter** with a focus on **offline-first functionality**. The system consists of three main components:

- **📱 onfly_app** → Mobile application built with Flutter.
- **🎨 onfly_design_system** → A standalone Design System package.
- **🖥 onfly_server** → A simple Dart backend to support the app.

## 🚀 Features

### 🏗 **Architecture**

- **Flutter Modular** → For dependency injection and module separation.
- **Cubit (Bloc)** → For state management.
- **SQLite (Drift)** → Local storage for offline-first functionality.
- **Dart Backend** → A lightweight backend using **Shelf** to handle API requests.
- **Clean Architecture** → Well-organized project structure.

### 📱 **Mobile App (onfly_app)**

✅ **Login Screen** → Authenticate users via email and password.  
✅ **Expense List** → Display, add, edit, and delete travel expenses.  
✅ **Corporate Card Screen** → Show balance, brand, and transactions.  
✅ **Travel Management** → Show travel details (boarding pass, flight time, airline, airport).  
✅ **Offline-First** → Works without internet, syncing data when online.  
✅ **Reports & Graphs** → Visualize expenses with filters.  
✅ **Dark & Light Theme** → Following Onfly’s Style Guide.

### 🎨 **Design System (onfly_design_system)**

✅ **Color Tokens** → Primary, Secondary, Success, Alert, Background.  
✅ **Typography** → Based on Poppins font.  
✅ **Buttons** → Primary, Success, Alert, Disabled (Filled, Outline, Text).  
✅ **Inputs & Fields** → Text fields, password fields, dropdowns.  
✅ **Cards & Lists** → Used for expense tracking.  
✅ **Tabs, Switches, Tooltips, and Status Components**.  
✅ **Light & Dark Mode Support**.

### 🖥 **Backend Server (onfly_server)**

✅ **Built with Dart (Shelf framework)**.  
✅ **Handles Authentication (mock login system)**.  
✅ **Provides API endpoints for expenses & travel management**.  
✅ **Simulates synchronization for offline-first functionality**.
